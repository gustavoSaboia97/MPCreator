MPCreator is a scientific workflow to control and automate the treatment of genomic metadata for phylogenomics analyses. 

MPCreator is available at:
        https://github.com/gustavoSaboia97/MPCreator
The command to pull the docker image is:
        docker pull saboia97/mpcreator 

MPCreator accepts as input an ID group, obtains the NCBI GenBank files (by the header) cleansing, filtering, and clustering metadate as localization, organism, gene, etc.Then, it organizes the sequences generating structured and organized files "by features" that can be used as input by phylogenetic programs such as RAxML/ExaML, PhyML, IQ-TREE, and BEAST.

To start that application, there is two ways
        1)By the interface:
            python3 MPCreator.py 
        2)By an '.txt' file:
            python3 MPCreator.py IDList.txt

            When using this method to input the IDs, you must separate the IDs by lines.s
            EX: 
            -------------------
            |    IDList.txt    |
            |                  |
            |    ID12324       |
            |    ID23123       |
            |    ID12312       | 
            -------------------
