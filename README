This is a scientific program that helps to separate DNA data from a file with mitochondrial gens

To start that application, there is two ways
        1)By the interface:
            python3 MPCreator.py 
        2)By an '.txt' file:
            python3 MPCreator.py IDList.txt

            When using this method to input the IDs, you must separate the IDs by lines.s
            EX: 
            -------------------
            |    IDList.txt    |
            |                  |
            |    ID12324       |
            |    ID23123       |
            |    ID12312       | 
            -------------------
